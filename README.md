Warning, there is a huge lack of documentation in this project.

For this project I was using https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa

Before I dropped the porject I had started rewriting all of the code, but I didn't get very far. https://github.com/joeymalouf/thesisModelingV2

I ran into a lot of problems with runtime. Anything that can do parallel computing is better, like a GPU.
Using something other than Python will definetly speed the running process up as well.
